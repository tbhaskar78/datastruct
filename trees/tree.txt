1. The height of a node is the length of the longest downward path to a leaf from that node
2. A node that has a child is called the child's parent node (or ancestor node, or superior). 
3. Nodes that do not have any children are called leaf nodes. They are also referred to as terminal nodes.
4. The depth of a node is the length of the path to its root (i.e., its root path). This is commonly needed 
   in the manipulation of the various self balancing trees, AVL Trees in particular.
